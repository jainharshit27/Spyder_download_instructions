## Software Installation Steps

__File 1__: Anaconda & Prerequisite Download Instructions (recommended)<br>
__File 2__: Spyder IDE Download Instructions

__NOTE__: To run or implement the Python code, to build our applications, we will use the Spyder IDE. To avoid any errors in commands such as “pip” in the latest Spyder versions, it is necessary to install Anaconda.

__NOTE__: If any errors persist for students, ask them to install using https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual instead of spyder.org. Guide them through the installation process using File 1.
