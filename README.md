Software Installation Steps

File 1: Anaconda & Prerequisite Download Instructions (recommended)
File 2: Spyder IDE Download Instructions: Link

NOTE: To run or implement the Python code, to build our applications, we will use the Spyder IDE. To avoid any errors in commands such as “pip” in the latest Spyder versions, it is necessary to install Anaconda.

NOTE: If any errors persist for students, ask them to install using Anaconda link instead of spyder.org
